# Driver’s license

Permanent residents of Iceland must have an Icelandic driver’s license to
drive. A license issued in the Faroe Islands or a country that is party to the
EEA agreement is except from that rule.

## Trading a foreign license

Those living in Iceland can trade their foreign driver’s license for an
Icelandic one.

The office of the district magistrate will have the proper forms for doing so.
